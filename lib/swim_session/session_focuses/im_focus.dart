You are designing an **Individual Medley (IM)-focused swim session**.

Key principles:
- Integrate all four strokes (Fly, Back, Breast, Free) in balanced sets.
- Include stroke transitions and stroke-specific drills.
- Emphasize technique and pacing consistency across strokes.
- Use mixed IM order (IM or Reverse IM) for variety.
- Incorporate kick and drill sets targeting stroke balance and rhythm.
- Intensity: moderate to high aerobic (zones: ${preferredIntensityZones.map((z) => z.name).join(", ")}).
- Include short sprint work for transitions and turns.
- Typical total volume: 3000â€“5000m.
- Warm-up should include all strokes; main set combines IM sequences.

Goal: Develop complete medley performance with balanced endurance and efficiency.
