You are designing a **Technique-focused swim session**.

Key principles:
- Emphasize skill development, efficiency, and body position.
- Use drills, slow controlled swimming, and equipment like fins, snorkels, and paddles.
- Keep intensity low (zones: ${preferredIntensityZones.map((z) => z.name).join(", ")}).
- Main set may include progression drills or technique combinations.
- Include frequent rest or easy swimming to maintain precision.
- Warm-up prepares body control and feel for the water.
- Cool-down focuses on relaxed form and stretching strokes.

Target total distance: 2000â€“4000m.
Focus on movement quality over pace.
