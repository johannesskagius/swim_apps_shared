### Swimmer Context
- Name: $swimmerName
- Focus strokes: $strokes
- Target distance: ${targetDistance}m
- Target duration: $durationText
- Event specialization: ${specialization.label}

### Objective
Generate a swim session for **$swimmerName**, a ${specialization.label} swimmer,
with approximately **$targetDistance meters total** work, tailored for the strokes: **$strokes**.

### Specialization Context
$specializationContext

### Session Requirements
- Keep total distance close to ${targetDistance}m.
- Distribute volume logically across warm-up, main set, and cool-down.
- Include stroke variety based on the focus strokes ($strokes).
- Output must be **plain text** formatted for `textToSessionParser`.
- Maintain physiological relevance to the swimmer‚Äôs specialization.
